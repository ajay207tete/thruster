# Vercel Speed Insights Integration - Implementation Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the thruster (cyberpunk-app) project, a React Native Expo web application. The integration enables performance monitoring and metric collection on the deployed application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Package Installation
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` (version ^1.3.1) to project dependencies
- Updated `client/package.json` and `client/package-lock.json` with the new dependency
- The package was installed successfully without breaking existing dependencies

### 2. Component Integration
- Modified `client/app/_layout.tsx` to import and integrate the SpeedInsights component
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react'`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component in the RootLayout JSX
- Positioned the component after the Analytics component to maintain consistent tracking setup

## Files Modified
1. **client/package.json** - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
2. **client/package-lock.json** - Updated lock file with new dependency
3. **client/app/_layout.tsx** - Integrated SpeedInsights component

## Implementation Details

### Framework Selection
The project uses:
- React 19.0.0 and react-dom 19.0.0
- React Native with Expo Router for web deployment
- The `@vercel/speed-insights/react` export was selected as it's the appropriate choice for React web applications
- This aligns with existing Vercel Analytics integration already in place

### Placement Strategy
- The SpeedInsights component was added to the root layout (`_layout.tsx`) to ensure it's initialized once at the application level
- Positioned alongside the existing Analytics component for consistency
- Placed within the TonConnectUIProvider context to ensure it's part of the main application tree

## Build Verification
- Successfully built the project with `npm run build` in the web platform
- Build completed without errors, generating 26 static routes
- Linting confirmed no new errors were introduced (pre-existing warnings remain)
- Verified SpeedInsights code is present in the bundled output

## Next Steps (For User/DevOps)
1. **Enable Speed Insights**: Go to Vercel dashboard → Select Project → Speed Insights tab → Click Enable
2. **Deploy**: Deploy the application to Vercel using `vercel deploy` or by connecting git repository
3. **View Dashboard**: After deployment and users visiting the site, metrics will appear in the Vercel dashboard

## Notes
- The implementation follows Vercel's official guidelines for React applications
- Compatible with the existing @vercel/analytics integration
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- The script will inject `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` after deployment (automatically handled by Vercel)
- Supports performance metrics collection for Core Web Vitals and custom metrics
