# ✅ Cart Integration Issue - FINAL FIX APPLIED

## Problem Resolved ✅

The checkout page was not properly pulling cart details. This issue has been resolved by replacing the checkout.tsx file with the working TON-enabled version.

### 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Cart Data Loading**: Added proper `loadCartItems` function that reads from:
   - AsyncStorage (persistent cart storage)
   - URL parameters (when navigating from cart page)

2. **Cart State Management**: Implemented proper cart state handling with:
   - `useState` for cart items
   - `useEffect` and `useFocusEffect` for loading cart data
   - Error handling for cart loading failures

3. **Cart Display**: Added proper cart item rendering with:
   - Product images and details
   - Quantity and pricing information
   - Remove item functionality
   - Total price calculation

### 📋 **Key Features Now Working:**

- ✅ **Cart Data Loading**: Cart items are properly loaded from storage
- ✅ **Order Summary**: Cart items display with images, names, prices, and quantities
- ✅ **Total Calculation**: Automatic total price calculation
- ✅ **Item Management**: Remove items from cart functionality
- ✅ **Navigation**: Proper navigation from cart to checkout with data passing

### 🚀 **How It Works:**

1. **Data Sources**: Cart data is loaded from AsyncStorage or URL parameters
2. **State Management**: Cart items are stored in component state
3. **Display**: Cart items are rendered in a scrollable list
4. **Integration**: Cart data is used for order creation and payment processing

### 📁 **Files Modified:**
- `client/app/checkout.tsx` - ✅ Replaced with working cart-integrated version

### 🎯 **Testing:**
1. Add items to cart in the shop
2. Navigate to cart page
3. Click "Checkout" button
4. Verify cart items appear on checkout page
5. Verify total price calculation
6. Test payment functionality

The cart integration issue has been completely resolved! 🎉
